        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I am more comfortable when there are fewer people around so my hobbies
           are not really much.

          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy reading novels. I can read any genre as long as it's long and
            interesting. I recently started reading on my phone but it isn't as
            interesting as reading a book. Also, reading a book when most books
            don't stay up to a week after you touch it makes you want to read it faster
            and be committed to it while it lasts but phones take that away.

          <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>
              I don't play a lot of video games but I am addicted to the few I play.
              I recently tried Call of Duty Mobile but that was because my play
              station 4 with all the FIFA games(2016-2020) is back home. I haven't
              played for a while because of the distance but I am currently on
              Master Rank in COD mobile so I use that to try and live without my
              soccer Games.
